// VARIABLE DECLARATIONS

// variables can be declared in four ways: automatically, var, let and const
// var was used before 2015 so should only be used for older browsers
// let and const were added in 2015

// let is used for variables that change
// const is used for constants

// variables defined with let and const have Block Scope
