    <h1>010 Grid</h1>
    <h3>grid terminology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        grid lines: if you have a grid with 4 columns then there is 5 grid
        column lines, the lines are numbered starting from 1, following the
        writing-mode and script direction, e.g. if writing is from left to right
        like english then 1 will be on the left, but it writing is right to left
        like arabic then 1 will be on the right
      </li>
      <li>
        grid tracks: a track is the space between two grid lines, so a grid row
        track would be the space between two row lines and a clumn track would
        be the space between two column tracks (a grid row track is just a row)
      </li>
      <li>
        grid cell: like a cell in a spreadsheet, by default each item is laid
        out one item into each defined cell
      </li>
      <li>
        grid area: several grid cells together, created by causing an item to
        span over multiple tracks
      </li>
      <li>gaps: space between tracks, you can't place content into a gap</li>
      <li>grid container: "display: grid"</li>
      <li>grid item: item which is a direct child of the grid container</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>rows and columns</h3>
    <p>
      - grid with, 3 column tracks (5em 100px 30%), 2 row tracks (200px auto)
      and 10px gap between tracks: (tracks are auto sized by default - as big as
      their content)
    </p>
    <div class="grid">
      <div>item</div>
      <div>item</div>
      <div>item</div>
      <div>item</div>
      <div>item</div>
    </div>
    <p><strong>intrinsic sizing keywords</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>min-content: track is as small as it can be without overflowing</li>
      <li>
        max-content: track becomes as wide enough for all of the content to
        display in one long unbroken string - can cause overflow as string will
        not wrap
      </li>
      <li>
        fit-content(): acts like a max-content at first, however once the track
        reaches the size you pass into the function, the content starts to wrap
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>- auto sized tracks are stretched to fit the container by default</p>
    <p><strong>the fr unit</strong></p>
    <p>- you can use fr to space out items using fractions</p>
    <p><strong>the minmax() function</strong></p>
    <p>
      - minmax(min_size, max_size) is used to set the min and max size for a
      track
    </p>
    <p>- fr units can be used inside the minmax() function</p>
    <p>
      - to force a track to take an equal share of the space in the grid
      container minus gaps use minmax, use minmax(0, 1fr), this makes the
      minimum size of the track 0 and not the min-content size
    </p>
    <p><strong>repeat() function</strong></p>
