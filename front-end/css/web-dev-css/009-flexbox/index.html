    <h1>009 Flexbox</h1>
    <p>
      - the main axis is the value set by "flex-direction: row | column", and
      the cross axis would the the other direction
    </p>
    <div class="parent">
      <div class="child">One</div>
      <div class="class">Two</div>
      <div class="child">Three</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      - by default: items are displayed as a row, they don't wrap, they don't
      grow to fill the container, they line up at the start of the container
    </p>
    <h3>direction of items</h3>
    <p>- flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse</p>
    <p>
      - you can use the property writing mode to change the direction of
      writing, e.g. if writing-mode:vertical-rl, then flex-direciton:row becomes
      top to bottom
    </p>
    <div class="mode">
      <div>one</div>
      <div>two</div>
      <div>three</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      - the start of the main direction is known as the "main-start", same with
      "main-end", "cross-start" and "cross-end"
    </p>
    <h3>wrapping flex items</h3>
    <p>
      - the initial value of flex-wrap: nowrap, meaning if there isn't enough
      space in the container the items will overflow, items will shrink as small
      as they can, down to the min-content size before overflow happens
    </p>
    <p>
      - to wrap use flex-wrap: wrap, when a flex container wraps it creates
      multiple flex lines, each flex line acts as its own flex container
      therefore you can't line up something in row 2 with something in row1
    </p>
    <p>
      - you can set both flex-direction and flex-wrap in shorthand using
      flex-flow, e.g. "flex-flow: column wrap;"
    </p>
    <h3>controlling space inside flex items</h3>
    <p>
      - given that there has more spacen in the flex container after the items
      are displayed, the items will not grow to fill this space, they stop
      growing at their max-content size, this is because the initial values of
      the flex- properties is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>flex grow: 0; items don't grow</li>
      <li>flex-shrink: 1; items can shrink smaller than their flex-basis</li>
      <li>flex-basis: auto; items have a base size of auto</li>
    </ul>
    <p>- the above list can be represented using flex: initial</p>
    <p>
      - flex: auto; makes the items grow (up to their max-content size),
      allowing large items to have more space than small ones, flex: auto has
      the following properties
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>flex-grow: 1; items can grow larger than their flex-basis</li>
      <li>flex-shrink: 1; items can shrink smaller than their flex-basis</li>
      <li>flex-basis: auto; items have a base size of auto</li>
    </ul>
    <p>- width: max-content | min-content | fit-content</p>
    <ul>
      <li>max-content: ideal size if there was unlimited space</li>
      <li>min-content: min size the box could take without overflowing</li>
      <li>
        fit-content: mix of max and min-content, if there is enough space use
        max-content, if not use min-content
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      - to make all the items have consistent size use "flex: 1" which is
      equivalent to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>flex-grow: 1; all items grow equally</li>
      <li>flex-shrink: 1</li>
      <li>
        flex-basis: 0; all items have 0 size therefore all of the space in the
        flex container is available to be distributed
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      - flex: none; items don't shrink or grow, this is purely used to access
      the alignment properties of flexbox without the flexible behaviour
    </p>
    <p>
      - you can individually define how much each item grows and shrinks, e.g:
    </p>
    <div class="flex">
      <div class="item1">one</div>
      <div class="item2">two</div>
      <div class="item3">three</div>
    </div>
    <p>- flex: 1 is the same as flex-grow: 1 (remember the shorthand)</p>
    <p>
      - above shows how item1 will always take up 1/6 of the space item2=2/6 and
      item3=3/6 no matter the size of the page, it is useful for responsive
      websites
    </p>
    <p>
      - flex: 1 1 auto; is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis
    </p>
    <h3>reordering flex items</h3>
    <p>
      - items can be ordered using the order property, for e.g. if you want a
      specific item to be placed 3rd in a row you can use order: 3, if multiple
      items have the same order then they will be displayed together the first
      element defined going first
    </p>
    <p>
      - it is not recommended to the order property as it can cause some
      problems, change your logical order in html instead!
    </p>
    <h3>flexbox alignment overview</h3>
    <p><strong>properties for space distribution</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>justify-content: space distribution on the main axis</li>
      <li>align-content: space distribution on the cross axis</li>
      <li>place-content: shorthand for setting both</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>properties for alignment</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>align-self: aligns a single item on the cross axis</li>
      <li>align-items: aligns all the items as a group on the cross axis</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>distributing space on the main axis</h3>
    <p>- you can use the following properties</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        - for the main axis use "justify-content: flex-start | flex-end |
        space-between | center | space-around | space-evenly | initial |
        inherit"
      </li>
      <li>
        - for the cross axis use the same property but you need to specify the
        height of the container to have space, you don't need to do this
        horizontally since divs span across the entire line
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>distributing space between flex lines</h3>
    <p>
      - you can use align-content with the same values as justify-content to
      distribute the flex lines on the cross axis, the initial value of
      align-content is stretch, (align-content is like justify-content but for
      flex lines)
    </p>
    <p>
      - place-content is shorthand for justify-content and align-content, if you
      only specify one value then it applies it to both, if two values, then the
      first value is align-content, second is justify-content
    </p>
    <h3>aligning items on the cross-axis</h3>
    <p>
      - in the cross axis you can align items within the flex line using
      align-items and align-self
    </p>
    <p>
      - the initial value of align-self is stretch which makes the all the items
      stretch to the height of the tallest item by default
    </p>
    <p>- align-item has the following values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>flex-start</li>
      <li>flex-end</li>
      <li>center</li>
      <li>stretch</li>
      <li>baseline</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>
      - flexbox works well with auto margins, it allows you to split items into
      groups: (item3 has margin-left: auto)
    </p>
    <div class="auto-margin">
      <div>one</div>
      <div>two</div>
      <div class="item3">three</div>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <h3>center an item vertically and hortizontally</h3>
    <p>- use justify-content: center and align-items: center</p>
    <div class="center"><div>center</div></div>
