    <h1>008 Layout</h1>
    <div class="sticky">sticky</div>
    <p>
      - you can't set an explicit width and height on inline elements, any block
      level margin and padding will be ignored by the surrounding elements
    </p>
    <h3>flexbox</h3>
    <p>
      - display:flex makes the parent a block-level box and converts its
      children to flex items
    </p>
    <p>
      - there are two main layout mechanisms that create layout rules for
      multiple elements: flexbox and grid
    </p>
    <p>
      - flexbox is for one-dimensional layouts, layouts across one axis
      (horizontal or vertical), by default flexbox will align the element's
      children next to each other, in the inline direction, and stretch them in
      the block direction, so they are all the same height. items will try to
      squash onto the same line as each other, they will not wrap when they run
      out of space, the properties align-items, justify-content and flex-wrap
      can be used to change this behaviour
    </p>
    <p>
      - in flexbox, the flex property can be used to control how the flex
      container and its children shrink or grow, the flex property is shorthand
      for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis e.g. "flex: 1 0 auto"
    </p>
    <h3>grid</h3>
    <p>
      - display:grid is similar to flexbox but it used for multi-axis layouts
      instead of single-axis layouts - when using display: grid, the repeat()
      and minmax() functions can be used for layout styling
    </p>
    <p>
      - a useful grid unit is the "fr" unit - which is a fraction of remaining
      space
    </p>
    <p>
      - in a grid container, grid-template-columns is a property used to define
      the size and number of columns, and the property gap is used to define the
      size of the gap between grid items
    </p>
    <p>
      - you can specify the position of a specific item in the grid using
      grid-row and grid-column
    </p>
    <h2>flow layout</h2>
    <p>
      - when not using flexbox or grid, your elements display in normal flox
    </p>
    <p>
      - in inline elements surrounding elements don't respect block margin and
      padding, you can use inline-block to make it
    </p>
    <h3>floats</h3>
    <p>
      - the float property instructs an element to "float" to the direction
      specified, e.g. make img float: left, which then allows sibling elements
      to "wrap" aroung it. the float property can make elements float left,
      right or inherit, to control the flow of the elements after the floated
      elements, use the property clear or using displat: flow-root which always
      establishes a new block formatting context for its contents
    </p>
    <h3>multicolumn layout</h3>
    <p>
      - you can also split a long list into multiple columns in normal flow
      using column-count or column-width (instead of specifying the number of
      columns), and column-gap
    </p>
    <h3>positioning</h3>

    <p>
      - the position property controls how an element in normal flow behaves, it
      has the following values: relative, absolute, fixed and sticky with the
      default being static
    </p>
    <p>
      - position:relative is positioned relative to its normal position, you can
      use the top, right, bottom and right properties to position them relative
      to itself. all the content surrounding the element will not reflow to fill
      the remaining space left by the relative element
    </p>
    <p>
      - position:absolute breaks the element out of the current document flow ,
      you can also use top, bottom, right and left to position the element in
      its nearest relative parent. all the content surrounding an absolute
      element reflows to fill the remaining space left by the absolute element
    </p>
    <p>
      - position:fixed is similar to absolute, with its parent being the root
      html element, they stay anchored from the top left based on the top,
      right, bottom and left values
    </p>
    <p>
      - position:sticky makes the element stay anchored to the top, right,
      bottom and left values relative to itself, even when a used viewport
      scrolls past the element, it becomes fixed
    </p>
