*** WHAT IS REACT? ***

- react is a declarative, component-based user interface library

- DECLARATIVE: you describe what you want but don't specify how to get it done

- COMPONENT-BASED: each component can be created, run and tested separately, then combined to create an app

- USER INTERFACE LIBRARY: focuses on solving one problem, creating user interfaces
